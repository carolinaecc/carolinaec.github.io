      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>

        The majority of my career has been dedicated to the tech and innovation space. Prior to Kellogg, I spent more than 3 years working at startups in Brazil. In this entrepreneurial environment, I was exposed to many different roles such as marketing, business development and operations.
